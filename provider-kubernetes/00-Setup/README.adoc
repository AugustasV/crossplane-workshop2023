* We are installing the Provider for Kubernetes.
* We also create a ServiceAccount for this Provider.
* And tell the Provider to use this ServiceAccount.

~~~
kubectl apply -f Provider.yaml
kubectl -n crossplane-system  get pods
~~~

Just wait till the installation is healthy

~~~
kubectl get providers
~~~



In theory we could run multiple Configs for a Provider.
We just want to address the local cluster.

~~~
kubectl apply -f ProviderConfig.yaml
~~~
