== Kubernetes Provider

* Manage Kubernetes Ressources using Crossplane
* It doesn't need to be Cloud
* [Repo](https://github.com/crossplane-contrib/provider-kubernetes)

== Idea

* Using Provider CRDs
* Create multi-bundle Compositions
* Create XRD

== Specials

* The Kubernetes Providers has some special features
* We will ignore this for the sake to focus on Crossplane core features.

== So we miss

* Install order
* Uninstall order
* Resource Management Policy
* Handling unmanaged resources

== But why a Kubernetes Provider?

* Maybe you like the (missing) features
* A way to integrate "vanilla" Kubernetes
* -> Multi-provider Deployments
* something else?
