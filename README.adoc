== Hi üëã

Welcome to the Crossplane workshop

==  Disclaimer

Both of us don't work or are associated to the company behind Crossplane

== Prerequisites

Let's make sure we've got everything.


* You need (cluster-admin) access to a K8s cluster
* A local one like kind, k3d, Docker Destop etc. works
* ‚òùÔ∏è If you just want to listen, that's fine too ‚òùÔ∏è
* ‚òùÔ∏è Just keep in mind we got some HandsOn stuff ‚òùÔ∏è

== Binaries you need

* `kubectl`
* `git`
* `helm`

== Cloud Credentials

* Credentials for AWS
* ‚òùÔ∏è This ist also optional, as we repeat only stuff we did with our local Kubernetes resources ‚òùÔ∏è


== Let's socialize

* Why are you here?
* What do you expect?

== And our plan is:

* Introduction 
* Concepts 
* HandsOn 
* Monitoring 
* Benefits 
* Drawbacks

== Cloudresources 

* We start using K8s itself as a resource
* It cumulates in using AWS
* There will be an Digitalocean example also


== Introduction Crossplane

The cloud native control plane framework

link:https://www.cncf.io/projects/crossplane/["Crossplane in the CNCF"]

== Installing Crossplane

We just use Helm to install the framework:

----
kubectl api-resources --api-group=apiextensions.crossplane.io
helm repo add crossplane-stable https://charts.crossplane.io/stable
helm repo update
helm upgrade --install crossplane --create-namespace \
    -n crossplane-system --set metrics.enabled=true \
    crossplane-stable/crossplane --wait
kubectl api-resources --api-group=apiextensions.crossplane.io
----

== Nice ShortCuts

* Get all Crossplane related Resources
* Yes Crossplane creates `Categories`
* As with `kubectl get all`

----
kubectl get crossplane
----

* Get all managed resources
* Should be empty

----
kubectl get managed
----

== Categories?

* Check other `Categories`

:)


----
kubectl get crd -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,CATEGORIES:.spec.names.categories
----


== The Cloud Native Control Plane Framework

* The cloud native control plane framework
* Universal control plane

== Control Plane?

* We know control planes
* Hey we know Kubernetes, so yes we know
* It is about managing "cloud" resources
* More precise:
** It is about managing any resource behind an **API**

== much more

* Crossplane provides a declarative API on top of the "cloud" resources
* Allowing to bundle these resources
* So we don't write code (YAML-engineering)

== Recap

* Think about Crossplane like a control plane for everything
* Giving you some gluecode CRDs on top 
* These CRDs work as usual in K8s-land

== Disclaimer

* We are still critical regarding Crossplane


== Basics ./. Managed Resource

* It is all about managing `Managed Resources`
* Like in Kubernetes
* Think about having RDS-Object
* Everything with an API :)

== So following is the same:

* API resources
* Cloud resources
* Cloud [resource] CRD


== Provider

* Later we install Providers 
* Our Cloud/API specific CRDs

[cols="3",options="noheader"]
|===
| Kubernetes
| AWS
| Digitalocean
| Azure 
| ArgoCD
| Helm
| ..
|===

== Kubernetes Workflow

* Crossplane extends the K8s-API
* Workflow is the same:
** Declaring  API resources
** Reconciliation (looping) API resources
** `kubectl` is still our friend <3

== ü§î

* So Crossplane (Providers) offers something like Terraform?!
* Jain üá©üá™
* It is declarative (Kubernetes way)




== Idea of Crossplane (sneak peak)

* Crossplane offers CRDs on top of Providers CRDs
* Divide between Consumers and Infra
* Hint: Kube-bind -> https://github.com/kube-bind/ (replacing providers)

== Dividing Consumers/Dev and Infra/Opsüò±? 

* Jain üá©üá™
* Infra defines an interface/API using CompositeResourceDefinition (XRD)
* Compositions fulfill the API by bundling Managed Resources
* Dev use Claims to instantiate Composite Resource (XR)
* XR represents a configured Composition

----
A Claim is to a XR what a PVC ist to a PV
----

== Rephrasing Infra

* Think about the Infra team as your cloud provider



== Provider

* Our Crossplane has no resources to access
* We need Provider to access API driven backends
* Providers are bundled as OCI-Images 

== So a Provider:

* Extends Crossplane with new Managed Resource Types
* CRDs for Cloud Resources
* Talks with the Cloud-API
* Needs credentials (ProviderConfig)
* Installs a Deployment
* Lists of Providers
** (https://github.com/crossplane-contrib)
** (https://github.com/upbound) 
** (https://marketplace.upbound.io/providers) 

== ProviderConfig

* While Provider _installs_ the provider control plane
* ProviderConfig _configures_ the provider control plane
* Most likely providing Credentials ‚òùÔ∏è

== Lobhudelei

* Reconciliation Loop all the time
* All as Code
* GitOps (aka everything is in Git)
* Shifting Left (to the Devs)
* Giving Complexity to the Ops aka Infra
